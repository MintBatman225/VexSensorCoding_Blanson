Hello Kids! I am giving you a test, this will allow me to assess your skills and build on your programming understanding. I want you to use the code I have provided for you to accomplish some very specific tasks.



1) Place the Sensor
2) Wire the Sensor 
3) Calibrate the Sensor ( Be able to explain to me what Roll, Pitch, and Yaw are)
4) Program the sensor to be calibrated
5) Instantiate the Sensor
6) Get the robot to drive forward (without sensor)
7) Get the robot to drive forward and turn right 90 degrees (without the sensor)
8) Get the robot to turn right 90 degrees with the sensor
9) have the robot drive, turn right 90 degrees, drive, turn left 180, and return to start


Your goal is to be able to explain to me each line and step. I want to see very clear comments within the code so thay even Coach V can read your code and understand what you have written.


Our goal is to explore the different Data angles given by the sensor. Then we want to write a programt o have the robot keep itself at a level angle. If it gets over a certain number the wheels will spin in one direction and vice versa.
Your goal is to be able to write the auto program by the end of the day.
