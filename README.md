# VexSensorCoding_Blanson

Okay so the goal for today is to get to robot moving on the field.


I want the following to happen:


The robot will call out the sensor
The robot will automatically Calibrate


The robot will roll until it hits / gets up partially on the bar

The robot will then execute an if statement


If the pitch of the robot is greater than what the flat calibrated position is then apply power to the wheels

Else do not move
